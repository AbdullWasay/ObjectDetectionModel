The dataset includes 1038 images.
Door are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -0째 to +0째 horizontally and -0째 to +0째 vertically
